	\section{Lab description}
	\label{servlet_description}
	The purpose of this weeks lab exercise is to
	\begin{enumerate}
	    \item Get introduced to the task manager Xml which you will be using during the lab exercises and hand ins throughout the course.
	    \item Get the Eclipse Java development environment running on your computers.
	    \item Make a small distributed application (web application) implementing the first version of the task manager using using XML and Java Servlets/JSP.
	\end{enumerate}
	As part of the exercise, you are required to extend the above Task Manager web application with the following functionality.
	\begin{enumerate}
	    \item Tasks by the Id: Get the task information or Xml for a supplied task id.
	    \item Tasks by the owner: Get the tasks owned by a given user name.
	    \item Tasks by the date: Get the tasks for a given date.
	\end{enumerate}
	Develop suitable Servlets or JSP pages to offer the above functionality in the Task Manager Application. Feel free to choose a simple design and user interface for taking input parameters and passing them to the server. For example, in case of developing JSP pages one may choose HTML input elements for taking the user input and use POST/GET method to pass the input parameters to server. On the other hand, if you developing servlets, then one may simply pass the input parameters to the server in the form of query string using GET method. In case of new servlets, donâ€™t forget to add servlet mappings in the web configuration file (web.xml).
	
	\section{Solution}
	\label{servlet_solution}
	Our solution is implemented using Jsp-documents. Jsp is a construct similar to Php: code sections written in a scripting language is embedded in a mark-up language or standing alone, and gets called whenever the resource is requested in order to dynamically construct a web response. In our documents, Java programming statements are embedded in an Html-page. The statements uses the XmlOutputter class to have the Jsp-tag in which it is embedded evaluate to an Xml-construct.\\
	The class JDOMParser provided with the assignment, is used to read from the task-manager-xml.xml document, and execute XPath queries on its contents.\\
	We have implemented three Jsp-documents, offering the functionality described in the assignment:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item GetAllTasks.jsp simply returns all available tasks found in the document. 
		\item GetTaskById.jsp searches for "task" elements in the Xml-structure that have in "id" attribute whose value is equal to the provided id. The id to look for is provided by the client as a part of the Http-formatted URI requesting the resource.\\
		As an invariant of the task collection back-end is that only a single task with a given id exists, this request should be expected to always evaluate to a single "task" element, although this is not explicitly enforced in the code.
		\item GetTasksByDate.jsp is nearly identical in structure to GetTaskById.jsp. It searches the document for tasks with a "date" attribute matching the provided URI-parameter. 
	\end{itemize}
	The assignment requires that an additional piece of functionality, allowing tasks to be identified by their "owner". As the Xml-schema provided did not include any data for an "owner" of a task, this was regarded to be a mistake. Had their been such data included, solving this part of the assignment would likely not exemplify anything not covered in the former functions. 
	
	\section{Test run}
	\label{servlet_test}
	The following section shows a request made to each of the three documents, and the resulting server response. During test run the servlets are running on localhost at port 8080.\\
	The Html surrounding the Xml-response have been removed as irrelevant to the content of the response.\\
