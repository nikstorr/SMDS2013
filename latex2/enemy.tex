	Security falls into 3 broad classes -
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Leakage: acquisition of info by unauthorized recipients 
		\item Tampering: Altering of info
		\item Vandalism: interference without gain to the perpetrator
		
	\end{itemize}
	
	Attacks on distributed systems are attacks on their communication channels and interfaces.  \\
	
	Attacks can be classified into the way a channel is misused -
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Eavesdropping
			\item Masquerading
			\item Message tampering
			\item Replaying
			\item Denial of service
		
		\end{itemize}
		
		To counter threats we can apply a mechanism or a policy (or both).\\
		
		A policy is to allow only some group/person access to my object(s)\\
		A mechanism is to lock the door and give keys to a group/person.
